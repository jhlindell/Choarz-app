# CHOARZ!

## What is this application?

Choarz is an application that serves two purposes. The primary purpose is to have a side project for learning new things and practicing coding skills. For instance, for this project, instead of using create-react-app I learned how to configure a project from the ground up using webpack and babel. I'm also taking the opportunity to develop using react hooks and function components where possible.

## What will it do?

Choarz will be a online chore tracking tool for my household. By assigning points to chores done and then allowing my boys to apply those points to rewards they want, I hope to teach them lessons about responsibility and what it feels like to earn things. Whether or not this will work is a problem domain for child psychology, not computer science. I'm just here to build an app and have fun doing it.

## What technologies will Choarz! use?

On the front end, Choarz is being built using the React framework with Redux for state management. Styling will be done with Material-UI.

On the backend, Node and Express will comprise the server. Mongo and Mongoose will be used for the database and database access. Testing on the backend will use Mocha as the test runner, where Jest/Enzyme will be used on the front end for component testing.
